# Mini PHP MVC
Small PHP MVC framework for little applications.

This small framework was built as a core to my MVC pattern PHP applications and is by no means a full framework. From here it can be and has been adapted in a variety of ways to suit each individual project, however it is a base to kick-start development and build upon.
